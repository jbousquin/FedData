**FedData version 3.0 has been released to CRAN! There are several breaking changes in the FedData API from version 2.x. Please see [NEWS.md] for a list of changes.**

`FedData` is an *R* package implementing functions to automate downloading geospatial data available from several federated data sources.

Currently, the package enables extraction from seven datasets: 

* The [National Elevation Dataset (NED)](https://ned.usgs.gov) digital elevation models (1 and 1/3 arc-second; USGS)
* The [National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset) (USGS)
* The [Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database](https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/) from the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS), which is led by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) under the USDA
* The [Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily), coordinated by National Climatic Data Center at NOAA
* The [Daymet](https://daymet.ornl.gov/) gridded estimates of daily weather parameters for North America, version 4, available from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC)
* The [International Tree Ring Data Bank (ITRDB)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology/tree-ring), coordinated by National Climatic Data Center at NOAA
* The [National Land Cover Database (NLCD)](https://www.mrlc.gov/)
* The [NASS Cropland Data Layer](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/SARS1a.php) from the National Agricultural Statistics Service

This package is designed with the large-scale geographic information system (GIS) use-case in mind: cases where the use of dynamic web-services is impractical due to the scale (spatial and/or temporal) of analysis. It functions primarily as a means of downloading tiled or otherwise spatially-defined datasets; additionally, it can preprocess those datasets by extracting data within an area of interest (AoI), defined spatially. It relies heavily on the [**sf**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) and [**terra**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=terra) packages.

### Demonstration
This demonstration script is available as an R Markdown document in the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/ropensci/FedData](https://github.com/ropensci/FedData).

#### Load `FedData` and define a study area
```{r load, results="hide", message=FALSE}
# FedData Tester
library(FedData)
library(magrittr)

# FedData comes loaded with the boundary of Mesa Verde National Park, for testing
FedData::meve
```

#### Get and plot the National Elevation Dataset for the study area
```{r NED, results="hide", message=FALSE}
# Get the NED (USA ONLY)
# Returns a raster
NED <- get_ned(
  template = FedData::meve,
  label = "meve"
)
# Plot with raster::plot
raster::plot(NED)
```

#### Get and plot the Daymet dataset for the study area
```{r DAYMET, results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Get the DAYMET (North America only)
# Returns a raster
DAYMET <- get_daymet(

)
# Plot with raster::plot
raster::plot(DAYMET$tmax$X1985.10.23)
```

#### Get and plot the daily GHCN precipitation data for the study area
```{r GHCN-precipitation, results="hide", message=FALSE}
# Get the daily GHCN data (GLOBAL)
# Returns a list: the first element is the spatial locations of stations,
# and the second is a list of the stations and their daily data
GHCN.prcp <- get_ghcn_daily(
  template = FedData::meve,
  label = "meve",
  elements = c("prcp")
)
# Plot the NED again
raster::plot(NED)
# Plot the spatial locations
sp::plot(GHCN.prcp$spatial,
  pch = 1,
  add = TRUE
)
legend("bottomleft",
  pch = 1,
  legend = "GHCN Precipitation Records"
)
```

#### Get and plot the daily GHCN temperature data for the study area
```{r GHCN-temperature, results="hide", message=FALSE}
# Elements for which you require the same data
# (i.e., minimum and maximum temperature for the same days)
# can be standardized using standardize==T
GHCN.temp <- get_ghcn_daily(
  template = FedData::meve,
  label = "meve",
  elements = c("tmin", "tmax"),
  years = 1980:1985,
